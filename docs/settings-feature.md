# Settings Feature Implementation

## Overview
Implementation of a new Settings page for RITA Go with its own unique layout and design system component from Figma-to-shadcn.

## Feature Requirements
- Standalone settings page with unique layout (not shared with other pages)
- Figma-to-shadcn component integration
- Protected route requiring authentication
- Settings management interface for user preferences

## Architecture Decisions

### Layout Strategy
- **Unique Layout**: Unlike chat/users/files pages that share RitaV1Layout, settings has its own dedicated RitaSettingsLayout
- **Component Location**: RitaSettingsLayout placed in `src/components/` as a page-specific component
- **Route Structure**: `/settings` at root level for direct access

### Component Structure
```
packages/client/src/
├── components/
│   └── RitaSettingsLayout.tsx  # Standalone settings layout from Figma
├── pages/
│   └── SettingsV1Page.tsx      # Settings page using unique layout
└── router.tsx                   # Route configuration
```

## Implementation Tasks

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Create feature branch `feature/settings`
- [x] Research existing V1 page patterns and routing structure

### 📋 TODO
- [ ] Create this documentation file
- [ ] Download and install RitaSettingsLayout from Figma-to-shadcn
- [ ] Create SettingsV1Page component
- [ ] Add /settings route with authentication
- [ ] Test integration and navigation

## Component Installation

### Figma-to-shadcn URL
```
https://rdhlrr8yducbb6dq.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/figma-to-shadcn/RitaSettingsLayout-wjtwxf7YqESnxVEgVvehxjgIquFFMZ.json
```

### Installation Process
1. Attempt CLI installation: `npx shadcn add [url]`
2. If CLI fails, manually download JSON and extract component
3. Create component file with extracted code
4. Integrate with routing and authentication

## Settings Sections (Expected)
- User Profile Management
- Application Preferences
- Security Settings
- Notification Preferences
- Integration Settings
- Theme/Appearance Settings

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Settings page loads correctly
- [ ] Authentication protection works
- [ ] Navigation to/from settings functions
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile/desktop
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] All interactive elements function properly

## Notes
- Settings page intentionally uses different layout pattern than other V1 pages
- Maintains consistency with RITA Go enterprise standards
- Follows SOC2 compliance requirements for settings management
